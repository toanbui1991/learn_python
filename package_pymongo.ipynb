The bed in the master was very comfortable and the kitchen was big enough for us. There is a washer that we used to do a load of laundry and left it to air dry while we were out. Generally, the apartment was clean, convenient, and the neighborhood pleasant. The only downside was that the air conditioning unit did not function effectively. It did not blow cool air and when turned down on the remote, it still felt like hot air. The unit had 2 small fans that we used at nights and these were effective.

As well, the water pressure and temperature in the shower did mess up whenever someone used the kitchen sink, so just be mindful of that! Also, you can clearly hear the next-door neighbour when you’re in the bedroom, so bring a pair of headphones if you have a hard time falling asleep through noise like me.\\n\\nIn terms of location, the fact that this apartment is right next to the Sagrada Familia is a huge part of its charm—  you could hear the bells from the living room and it was magical! However, I did find it to be a little inconvenient when wanting to go to the city centre (La Rambla and Placa De Catalunya) because it is at least a 40-minute walk away. However, the metro system in Barcelona is very straightforward to use and there are many bus and subway routes near Mar’s apartment because the Sagrada is such a huge tourist attraction! \\n\\nThanks for a wonderful stay, Mar.

We loved the charm of the building & neighborhood (and the cleanliness of the apt).  The studio apt. was the right size for two of us who were more interested in exploring Montreal than staying around in an apt.  The apt. is a short walk to the Metro station (at Mont Royal) and a short walk from MANY dining and entertainment options.  Zaki even recommended a couple of places for dinner (we choose the \"best poutinne in Montreal\" spot).  We knew that the apt. didn\\'t have air conditioning (as stated) but we were disappointed that the only screened opening in this interior apt. was broken.  If you are thinking of visiting in the heat of summer, this is less than ideal.  The other issue that people traveling by car have to be aware is the lack of parking in this entire area.  There is free parking in limited spots but it is only for certain times of day, so we either had to hang around the neighborhood jumping from spot to spot or risk getting a ticket (they don\\'t tow)...we got ticketed (but were lucky because we only received one ticket in a two day period of time).  But, even though there were some issues to deal with, we loved the feeling of being a part of this active Montreal neighborhood.  P.S.

There's a fan that we kept on but it just blows hot air around. I tried a bucket of ice in front of the fan but could not cool the place down.\\nThe other issue is given a $40 cleaning fee, while the place looks clean, when I turned on the shower the water back up because of hair and guck in the drain. Some towels did not smell clean and bedspread/sheets had some stains.  Not a big deal but when charging a $40 fee not acceptable. \\nOverall, we were mainly disappointed because it should not cost the host much to have a small a/c unit that can be turned on for hot days and nights and that would have made all the difference.\"}, {'_id': '174033021', 'date': {'$date': {'$numberLong': '1500868800000'}}, 'listing_id': '4865672', 'reviewer_id': '25542193', 'reviewer_name': 'Megan', 'comments': 'We unfortunately found ourselves in a situation where our airbnb was completely uninhabitable, but our host was not willing to provide a refund. On the evening of our arrival, we soon discovered that the bathtub faucets were in such disrepair that the water could not turn off after use. As the tub filled up quicky with water from the broken faucet and a bad drain, we had to use kitchen pots to bail water out of the tub for 40 min until the host arrived. Although Zaki was immediately reachable by phone, we were unable to communicate our issue due to the language barrier. After hanging up to write to Zaki on the airbnb app, he said he would come to the apartment in 20 minutes. He did arrive until 40 minutes later.\\n\\nHe arrived and managed to turn the faucet off by jamming and twisting the shower head toggle and tap at the same time. Clearly, he knew the faucets were broken before but did not bother to fix it. Further, it seemed that he had broken the faucet even more in the process of turning the water off. So at this point the hot water knob no longer worked and water could only come out of the bottom spout, and not the shower head. Then, Zaki tried to tell us that this was due to \"city work\" when clearly, anyone could look at the shower and tell that it was in bad shape to begin with. He then suggested we could shower by using the KITCHEN POTS to catch water and pour over ourselves. We told him that we were leaving and he agreed to refund us the rest of the trip (2 nights). Later, when Zaki had left, he messaged to tell us that he would only refund us $200 even though we paid $108 per night plus $100 in service fees and cleaning fees.  We ended up wasting the entirety of our first day and half in Montreal dealing with the bathtub situation and filing a complaint with airbnb customer service. Luckily, they were extremely helpful and got us the full refund. \\n\\nAnother thing to note is that the apartment was not clean. There is a strong odour that is noticeable as soon as you walk in.
