    "1. Reading data from text files\n",

    "4. Writing data to Cloud Storage as text files\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute this pipeline locally, first edit the code to specify the output\n",
    "location. Output location could be a local file path or an output prefix\n",
    "on GCS. (Only update the output location marked with the first CHANGE comment.)\n",

    "Then, run the pipeline as described in the README. It will be deployed and run\n",
